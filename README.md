# HERMES

Hermes is an email template editor to build beautiful, responsive emails quickly and easily. The app is developed with ruby on rails but now I would like to use vue.js for frontend.

# FEATURES

# DEMO

Here is a working live demo : https://hermes-builder.herokuapp.com/

# SETUP

Clone this repo to your desktop and run ruby -v to make sure you have ruby >= 2.4.1 installed

# USAGE

After you clone this repo to your desktop, go to its root directory and run bundle install to install its dependencies.
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run rake db:create db:migrate db:seed to create and populate the database. 
Then you can use foreman start to launch the application. You will then be able to access it at localhost:5000.

You will be allow to access admin panel with following login : admin@test.com / p@ssword
